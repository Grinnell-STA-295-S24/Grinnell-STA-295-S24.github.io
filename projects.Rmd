## Overview
One of the most important functions of the working statistician is to investigate and answer significant research questions by analyzing real-world data, using a variety of elementary and advanced modeling techniques, and to distill the results into reports that are accessible to the non-statistician. 

You will work in small groups to explore a topic of interest to you, building appropriate predictive models to answer a research question, and then summarize your results in a short presentation to the class and as well as in a technical report submitted to the instructor.

## Due Dates

1. Group Membership: 5pm Friday, March 15th (Week 8) via Email

2. Project Proposal: 5pm Monday, April 8th (Week 10) on GitHub

3. Draft of Data and Exploratory Data Analysis sections: 5pm Monday, April 22nd (Week 12) on GitHub

4. Technical Report Rough Draft: 5pm Friday, May 10th (Week 14) on GitHub

5. Presentation: Thursday, May 16th 9am - noon

6. Final Technical Report: Friday, May 17th by 5pm on GitHub

## Project Goals

During your project, you will ...

1. Collect multivariate data appropriate for regression or classification tasks.

2. Articulate clear and compelling research questions that can be answered by building predictive models on an appropriate data set.

3. Implement data wrangling in order to pre-process data for analysis.

4. Perform exploratory data analysis using data visualizations and descriptive statistics to understand the structure of your data.

5. Build and assess predictive statistical models in order to answer the research question.

6. Craft a clear, engaging narrative answering the research question in a technical report.

7. Share the results of your investigation with your peers through a presentation.

## Components

### Groups

You will arrange yourselves into groups of 2 - 3 students each. One person in your group should submit a list of group members to me via email by **5pm on Friday, March 15th**. On Friday evening, I will sort any students who didn't express group preferences into groups.

### Project Data

For this project, you will need to collect or obtain a rich multivariate data set with many observations that can be used to build predictive models to answer a research question. Generally, this data will likely need to contain a categorical or quantitative response variable, at least 4 other predictors, and at least 100 observations (although larger data sets are encouraged).

Some resources for finding appropriate data can be found below:

  - Grinnell College Libraries [Data Best Bets](https://grinnell.libguides.com/c.php?g=1057667&p=7689520), a list of large, general-purpose, user-friendly aggregations of data covering a variety of topics.
  
  - [Stat2Labs](https://stat2labs.sites.grinnell.edu/DataResources.html), a site providing project-based mateirals that emphasize real-world applications and conceptual understanding.
  
  - Grinnell [Data Analysis adn Social Inquiry Lab Downloadable Data](https://dasil.sites.grinnell.edu/downloadable-data/), a page dedicated to several DASIL-affiliated data sets for download.
  
  - [UC Irvine Machine Learning Repository](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/), a collection of curated data sets widely used by the Machine / Statistical Learning community for model building.
  
  - [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets), an extremely large repository of data sets covering wide variety of topics. **Warning** The quality, usability and authenticity of these data sets are not as thoroughly assessed as those from other sources; use data from this site with caution. 
  


### Project Proposal

By **5pm Monday, April 8th**, your group will draft a well-written project proposal outlining your project and upload the .pdf document to your group's GitHub repository. The proposal should include the following information:

- At least 1 paragraph of background information on the topic you wish to study.

- A precise statement of the research question you wish to answer.

- A candidate for the data sets that you can analyze.

- A description of the type of data you will use to answer your question, and a list of variables you might include in your analysis

- At least 1 paragraph describing the utility of an answer to your research question, or a discussion of why an answer would be interesting or relevant to you.

- A brief discussion of any obstacles you foresee either in data acquisition or analysis.
