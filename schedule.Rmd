*Responses to questions should be added as an answer on the day's post in the `Discussions` section on the class Github Organization [Grinnell-STA-295-S24](https://github.com/Grinnell-STA-295-S24). These responses should be submitted before the start of class* 

Answer **ONE** of the following two questions:
 
1. Suppose we want to predict the value of $Y$ based on three variables $X_1, X_2, X_3$. In what ways is a single multiple regression model for $Y$ based on $X_1, X_2, X_3$ different from creating 3 separate simple regression models for $Y$ based on each of $X_1$, $X_2$ and $X_3$ individually.

2. Give an intuitive explanation for why training $R^2$ will always increase as more predictors are added to a model, while the number of observations are held fixed. Then explain why adding more predictors will not necessarily lead to a more accurate model.

1. Give a real-world example of a response and pair of predictors that may have a *synergy* or interaction effect, and explain why we might expect this effect based on context. (Recall: an interaction occurs when the effect of one variable on the response is amplified or diminished as the values of the other variable change)
